Targeting 'girls' exclusively is a misjudgment of usage demographics and market potential.\"\n  },\n  \"price_analysis\": {\n    \"price_in_inr\": 89000,\n    \"price_fit\": \"Extremely poor\",\n    \"ideal_price_range\": \"INR 50–600 per pack (10–20 units), INR 1000–3000 for premium multi-pack or specialty products\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"INR 89,000 is thousands of times above the standard condom pricing in India, where even ultra-premium options rarely exceed INR 2000. The market is highly price sensitive, and such a high price signals either misunderstanding or miscategorization.\"\n  },\n  \"cultural_fit\": {\n    \"score\": 2,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Condoms face cultural stigma in India, especially in non-urban settings, but this is easing in Tier 1 cities due to rising sexual health awareness.
